## How to download ?

As of now, there are no official releases of VirtuVirus. The current way to get VirtuVirus is to either run it from source, or to grab the latest executable from the Actions tab.
Currently, the executables provided are for Windows and Linux.

In the event you cannot/don't want to use them, it is possible to manually run the Python code straight from source.

## Requirements (when using source)
- *A recent version of Python 3*
- *Tkinter (with the Ttk module)*

All other dependencies should be already bundled with Python.

## How do I use it ?

*[Placeholder]*

As of now, the current types of agents are :
- ðŸ”µ **Sane** : This agent has yet to be infected. It possesses no resistance to the infection, and will rush less often to the center the more infected agents there are.
- ðŸ”´ **Infected** : This poor agent just got infected, either by being spawned because of you or by catching the infection from another agent. They will always avoid rushing to the center, as they know they represent a danger : on every frame, any agent in their range has a chance to be infected !
- ðŸŸ¢ **Immune** : Luckily, they got over the infection, since the chance for them to recover slowly increases over time. They won't bother evading their needs anymore, since they can't get sick again... for now.
- âšª **Dead** : Some, however, are less lucky. They do not survive their infection, and will die, stopping any movement. Notice how the more infected agents there are, the more deaths happens : it is meant to represent public services becoming overloaded.

## F.A.Q

### Both the program and the source refuse to run on Linux when using Wayland ! What do I do ?

Tkinter's Wayland support is quite buggy. Weirdly enough, I've noticed that running Tkinter programs using Visual Studio Code's terminal fixes this issue. Perhaps other terminals will also properly work.

## Bug Reports / Contributions / Suggestions
